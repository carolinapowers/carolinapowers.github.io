                    <h1>You can learn anything!</h1>
                    <p>You can learn anything. Você pode aprender qualquer coisa. Usted puede aprender cualquier cosa. What?! That's right! あなたは何を学ぶことができます Don't believe me? Well, google it! You will find that the newest researches show that the brain acts like a muscle. The more you use it, the more it develops its abilities. The more you use it and struggle, the more it grows. After decades of research on achievement and success, Professor Carol Dweck has found out that most people are held back not by their innate ability, but their mindset. Based on her researches, she has developed the Growth and Fixed Mindset concept. Let's take a closer look at this concept.</p>

            <p>A growth mindset is when students or people believe that their abilities or intelligence can be developed. It's when they believe that success comes from effort, practice and hard work. It's when they believe that if they have not accomplished or learned something yet, it's only a matter of time. Professor Dweck has found through her researches that students with a growth mindset exhibit confidence, happiness, a good attitude towards challenges and the love for learning. She has found out that those students who have switched their mindset from fixed mindset to a growth mindset, have improved their ability to learn greatly. So, let's take a look at some key attributes of a fixed mindset.</p>

            <p>A fixed mindset is when people believe that traits are set in stone. It's when they believe that some people are born gifted and that each person has their natural talents. It doesn't matter how hard you try something, you're either good at it or bad. Students with a fixed mindset tend to give up easily when faced with a challenge. This type of mindset does not allow you to believe that you can learn anything through working hard and struggling. But, don't be fooled, you can learn anything!</p>

            <p>Do you think you have a growth mindset or a fixed mindset? I believe I have a little bit of both. I have experienced some of what an individual with a fixed mindset has. I grew up excelling in sports and subjects in school, I was a quick learner, and I never enjoyed a challenge due to the fear of failing. On the other hand, as I go through my experience as a student at The Iron Yard, I am practicing a growth mindset. I am working very hard and I am struggling. I am slowly moving in the right direction. I am not there YET, but it's just a matter of time. Now, I am not brilliant anymore, but I do work hard because I was told that I can learn anything!</p>

            <p>Do you believe you can learn anything? Don't doubt it anymore! You can learn anything. Você pode aprender qualquer coisa. Usted puede aprender cualquier cosa. あなたは何を学ぶことができます</p>
